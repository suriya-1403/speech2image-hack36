## Introduction:
In this fast-moving world, Educations plays an important life among students. Hearing students constantly absorb new information and knowledge through the daily noises, conversations, and language that is spoken around them. Deaf and hard-of-hearing students do not have that luxury and face very difficult situations compared to other normal students. Our project focus on deaf students who often lag behind their hearing peers when it comes to concepts, understanding capacity, and languages. 

In this project, we created an app called “ Ease Edu “ completely made for kids under the age of 10 who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing students. This app performs a visual representation via images based on the input given as voice by teachers. This app enhances the understanding capacity of concepts taught and develops interest among the students. Teachers can bridge this gap by being flexible in the way that they respond to the educational concerns of their deaf students
